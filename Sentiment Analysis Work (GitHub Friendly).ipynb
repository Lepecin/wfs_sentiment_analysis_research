It's been running around probably for several weeks and we just now know what we're looking for. It's popped up in 3 different continents outside Africa in the four-ish days since it was publicly announced so you can safely say these new cases are not the first.\n",

      "\n",
      "By the by, I'm not an epidemiologist, but I do covid testing in a hospital so i do have some actual knowledge in the area. It is really fucking hard to track variants because most people who walk through our doors that get tested never have samples sent to the state. If it's positive we do 0 further investigation and I've worked in several facilities in the country who follow the same protocol. Most of the cost efficient and widely used tests (see Abbott Id now) don't go any further than testing for all variants and it would be really impractical to go further and send every positive sample out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Early covid we had to send samples to the state labs or ref labs and it would take 8 to 10 days to get results back. We won't run into this issue specifically again, but if we were to send out every positive sample for specific genotyping would likely develop a decent backlog. After a certain period it does very little good because by the time we know we need to do contact tracing it's already spread once, maybe twice depending on how backlogged they get. Not to mention that biotech companies would have to design and manufacture en mass the kits to do it. The lag there would put us in the middle of a wave if this thing really ramps up. Now it is easy to design new pcr primers, but again you still need them in bulk and it's really tough to do it in a high throughput capacity because it actually takes skilled labor which we are really, really short on.\n",
      "\n",

Pretty confident itll push an ath if the fear mongering continues. That is barring a true market crash, but this isn't the black swan you are looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit numero dos- I am strongly assuming this won't bring about a horrible death-toll or put us at essentially a new game + version of covid. My concern is labor disruption due to the unvaccinated population getting run through (even if it is mild) and breakthrough infections. A lot of work places demand you stay home if infected or if you're the responsible type and test positive and decide to quarantine your employer can't say anything because it's an osha violation. This is the big concern on the market - how will it further fuck supply chain issues because of staffing issues. Past that I'm not saying it's a nothingburger, but it's probably just more of the same as delta is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit 3 because I'm tired of explaining it - I'm a medical lab scientist, but its easiest just to say lab tech and far less pompous. I have a 4 year degree with upper level courses in immunology, infectious disease, and a lot of other shit that's not completely relevant to covid. I'm not a doctor nor do I claim to be, but I work 20 feet from an ER and see critical covid cases on the reg and do play a role in those cases. I'm not a high-school grad making minimum wage who can barely be trusted to pipette things. I've also done a few years research in micro, molecular and biochemistry.

      "#**Introduction**\n",
      "The best part about trading options is that you can leverage any stock you want, in any direction you want. The worst part about options trading is that their value decays over time and they have an expiration date. The ZEBRA 🦓 strategy is a spread that allows you to keep most of the leverage and remove the decay. I'll give a very beginner level explanation of what the strategy is, how to set it up, and why it is able to effectively remove the decay from your options. \n",
      "\n",
      "#**Intrinsic And Extrinsic Value Refresher**\n",
      "If you understand the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic value you may skip to the next section. Options always have both intrinsic value and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is real value, value that you could redeem right now if you executed the contract. If you have a call on Intel with a strike price of $30 and Intel is trading at $45 then this call already has $15 (* 100) worth of real value. This is because you could execute your contract, buy your 100 shares for $30, and then turn around and sell them for $45. When you buy an option where the strike price is lower than the current price this value is going to be priced into the option. This is its intrinsic value. The rest of the value of an option is extrinsic value, that's basically the cost of the uncertainty/potential of the contract going forward. If Intel is trading at $45 and you buy a call with a strike price of $45 this has no real value, but because it very easily could have real value in the future you need to pay for that chance. However, if you buy a $100 call on Intel this is unlikely to happen, so it's not worth very much. The closer the option's strike price is to the real price the more extrinsic value there will be. \n",
      "\n",
      "#**Delta Refresher**\n",
      "If you understand what the concept of delta is and where to find it within your brokerage you may skip to the next section. Every option contract has multiple significant values called \"the greeks\" that explain its behavior. I'm only going to be using delta for this strategy, and only one part of it. Delta ranges from 0 to 1 for calls and 0 to -1 for puts. A call with an At The Money (ATM) strike price, where the current price and the strike price are almost the same, will often have a delta near 0.50 (often just called 50). A call with a strike price much lower than the current price is called In The Money (ITM), and will usually have a delta between 0.5 and 1. Lastly a call with a strike price much higher than the current price is called Out Of The money (OTM) and will usually have a delta between 0.5 and 0. What does this value mean though? \n",
      "\n",
      "#**Setting Up The Strategy**\n",
      "Delta has a lot of different meanings and uses, but for the purposes of this strategy you only need to realize that the delta value is a rough approximation of the number of shares that option will be representing. A 50 (0.5) delta call will be moving with the power of about 50 shares of the underlying stock. **If you want to effectively remove decay from your options here's what you do.** \n",
      "\n",
      " * Pick the stock or index you want to add leverage to\n",
      " * Pick if you are bullish or bearish on that ticker\n",
      " * Pick how much time you want for this spread to play out (> 1 year is suggested)\n",
      " * Purchase two 70 (0.7) delta calls (if bullish) or two -70 (-0.7) puts (if bearish)\n",
      " * Write (sell) one 50 (0.5) delta call (if bullish) or one -50 (-0.5) put (if bearish)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to result in a payout chart that looks very very similar to if you were owning the stock, but with some leverage and an expiration date.\n",
      "\n",
      "#**Why Does This Work?**\n",
      "The two ITM calls (where extrinsic value is relatively low and real value is relatively high) provide you with a lot of real value and little extrinsic value. When you turn around and sell the ATM call (where extrinsic value is very high and intrinsic value is zero) you are making it so that the high extrinsic value of this call matches the combined extrinsic value of the two ITM calls. If you buy $100 worth of extrinsic value and then sell $100 worth of extrinsic value you won't have any left. If you have no extrinsic value you have no decay. This means that while the calls still have an expiration date, they do not decay in value. If our Intel calls from earlier go up even 1% you will profit to some degree and because you have one call without a sold counterparty your potential profit is technically infinite, just like with stock, but unlike many other spreads. \n",
      "\n",
      "#**Conclusion**\n",
      "This strategy is perfect if you want to leverage something without relying on a large price increase or decrease to reach your breakeven point. It's still highly dangerous because if the ticker does not move your way you will still lose all of the money you invested if you didn't cut your losses at some point. This should be used a small part of your portfolio on something you have reason to be very bullish or very bearish on to amplify potential returns.

Dividends have been rising by ten per cent a year and free cash flow yields are around ten per cent relative to where bond yields are.

The pullback is because of the news of the variant but guys. You have to remember that if another lockdown happens, $RBLX to the moon, and even if there isn't, it will go higher because you know the \"metaverse\" shit or whatever the fuck they call it. Most importantly, whatever the fuck Pelosi owns goes up, and $RBLX is one of them.\n",

      "This new South African variant is giving the market reason for concern, but the fact of the matter is we need more data to truly know what this entails for the global economy. We saw a similar drop a couple months back when Delta cases were picking up. I still think there is no alternative to stocks with treasuries at negative real rates (return<inflation). Therefore I'm staying invested and will look at today as a buying opportunity. I believe this drop in yields (bullish for tech) will spark a rotation to tech names, but that doesn't mean I'm bearish on the SPY.  I believe the risk of selling here is actually greater than the risk of holding just because simply the money supply and inflation are both very high and there is NO alterative. The annual inflation rate in the US surged to 6.2% in October of 2021, the highest since November of 1990 and isn't slowing. Portfolio managers will be forced to stay invested if not they risk looking like a fool losing 5-6% to inflation\n",

Now before yall come at me with the 80 billion texting app, I am not buying this based off of fundamentals. As we all saw today, the market finessed every retard who had calls on anything--except a few stocks, like Snapchat. Now with the Unicorn variant bs, I can't be the only one that thinks the market overreacted to it, and now is a good time to buy some leaps.\n",

Well after doing a bit of technical analysis, I have found Snapchat to have support at the 47-49 area (this is based on the daily not the 1 nanosecond). Now given the fact that it is hanging on to that support as of now, and has recently plummeted a lot, what are the chances that Snap will actually be a good bet to buy a leap on?\n",

      "Also, analysts have rated the stock pretty high, claiming it will hit \"65$\" by end of year--they are retards, and I know that, but if enough retards think it will hit 65 then it theoretically should. Interested in hearing your thoughts of this swing strategy of buying leaps, or just options in general, on stocks that outperform the market; Roughly 60% of the volume of stocks comes from the market, and given that it could just rebound back to 470$, Snap would fly up very fast.

For example, clothing companies that stock in seasonal fashions might end up loaded down with inventory no one will want in 3-4 months.

The trick however, is that because IV is so low, IV will (already has and will continue to) jump during any crash, causing the price of the overall spread to increase, making your risk area shrink down and over, consolidating to right around expiration time. IV can be expected to be at 50-60 on both the way down and way back up (topping at 80-100+ at the bottom of any crash), so you can reasonably expect to have plenty of time to analyze the situation and hold onto the spread for further profit, or if you think a legitimate rebound is likely, close the spread for a profit and buy calls/call debit spreads/synthetic long position and ride the wave back up.\n",

Do you really think he’d still be in charge if stocks did poorly under him? Probably not is the answer there.”\n",

      "> * Taking another look at Greenspan’s 312% return and we realize he was in charge of the Fed for 18.5 years. So his annual return of 8.0% puts things in perspective.\n",
      "> * The shortest tenure ever was less than a year and a half back in the late 1970s under William Miller. Meanwhile, the longest ever was William Martin at nearly 19 years.\n",
      "> * Paul Volker had the best annualized return at 15.2% over his 8 years. Not to mention he handed things over to Greenspan right before the 1987 crash, one of the best handoffs we’ve ever seen in history.\n",
      "> * Lastly, the Fed has been led by a woman only once and that was Janet Yellen, now in charge of the Treasury. It is worth noting that her four-year run at the Fed produced a very impressive 12.9% annualized return for stocks.\n",

      "> We view these nominations as very market friendly. Powell has done a commendable job supporting markets during the COVID-19 shutdowns and we aren’t quite through with the pandemic. We believe stability and leadership continuity is important as we continue to make our way toward the finish line of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Brainard is well qualified to run the Fed, elevating her to Vice Chair recognizes her contributions and potentially puts her in a position to take over the Chair role in four years. Both positions require Congressional approval, and we think both should be confirmed when Congressional hearings conclude sometime over the next few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “As we expected, President Biden chose continuity and familiarity with these Fed appointments,” noted LPL Financial Fixed Income Strategist Lawrence Gillum. “Going with Powell over Brainard is what markets were expecting, so we think markets are relieved that Fed leadership uncertainty is now out of the way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> The knee-jerk reaction in the bond market was interesting in that markets seemingly continue to shift the prospects for interest rate hikes forward. As seen on the LPL Research Chart of the Day, Treasury securities across all maturities sold off with two-year tenors among the most (negatively) impacted. Now, two-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the pandemic began. Short maturity securities are the most impacted by changes in monetary policy. Moreover, markets are pricing in nearly three rate hikes next year with the first rate hike expected in June, which is much more aggressive than the Fed has indicated.\n",

      "\n",
      "> President Biden still has three open Fed Board of Governor positions to fill, so we’re a long way from knowing for sure how Fed policy may change over the next few years. However, we would expect Biden to select governors on the dovish side of the spectrum. That said, the 2022 voting rotation with regional Fed Presidents may impart a hawkish lean to the FOMC overall, offsetting some of the dovish bias from Biden’s appointments. The rotation replaces three solidly dovish and one strongly hawkish voting members with two strongly hawkish and two solidly hawkish officials. Monetary policy is managed at the national level, so while the regional presidents will no doubt have influence, we continue to think the Fed will be more accommodative than markets are currently expecting. In addition, with the announcements today, leadership at the top of the Fed should be seen as being supportive to the economy and thus supportive for markets.\n",

      "> # Pandemic and Multi-Decade Low for Claims\n",
      "\n",
      "> Out of the massive slug of economic data this morning, one major bright spot was jobless claims. It has now been 88 weeks since the March 13, 2020 release; the last one before claims began to print in the millions. In that time, claims have fallen to not only take out pre-pandemic levels and the low prior to that of 203K set in April 2019 but today saw the first sub-200K reading since November 20, 1969. That compares to estimates of a reading of 260K and last week's 2K upward revised number of 270K. On a side note, in 2019 there were three weeks where the initial release of initial claims came in below 200K (1/24, 4/11, and 4/18), but they have been since revised higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-SA.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> While that is a significant low in claims, the drop appears to a large degree to be thanks to seasonal adjustment. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose to 258.6K which was the highest level in six weeks. It is seasonally normal for claims to head higher during the current week of the year with it having happened over 80% of the time historically. Additionally, that is a bit of catch-up considering claims have been bucking seasonal trends in recent weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/112421-Claims-Seasonal.png))**\n",
      "\n",
      "> Continuing claims were also lower this week falling from 2.109 million to 2.049 million. As with initial jobless claims, that sets a new low for the pandemic that is 265K above the level from March 13, 2020.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "> Factoring in all other programs creates an additional week of lag to the data meaning the most recent print is through the first week of November. The final week of October's unusual uptick on account of peculiar growth in claims for expired programs has unwound in the most recent week's data. PUA claims were more than cut in half as PEUC claims also fell by 121K. Combined that resulted in a new low of 2.44 million claims.\n",

      "tl;dr -- Tapering will contribute to a rise in interest rates in 2022. This will contribute to a decrease in the growth of the money supply. Since the supply of money should still grow, stonks will probably go up but not as much. Only caveat, should interest rates rise too fast, and money growth slow down too much, a sell off in the equity market is possible. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and possibly start increasing the amount of QE. \n",

Now, as promised in the comments, I am now writing my follow up for what happens when the FED tapers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But first, let's recap what we learned:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Banks use reserves as collateral to create more money. They do this by giving loans or by buying government debt. In both cases, this creates more deposits in the banking system, expanding the money supply. More stimy checks plz!\n",
      "2. A downturn in the credit cycle sucks donkey dick. No one wants it, so what do we do? Cut interest rates and increase bank reserves to make credit cheaper. This stops the downturn in its stupid little tracks and resumes the endless expansion of debt & money. 💩\n",
      "3.  Once short term interest rates are at 0%, it's time to bring out the big guns, QE. QE allows the central bank to swap whatever assets they want on a banks balance sheet for reserves. This have the following effects:\n",
      "   1. Increases the reserves in the banking system, allowing banks to buy more government debt and give bigger loans (i.e. access to credit becomes cheaper)\n",
      "   2. Whatever the central bank is buying drives down the supply of that asset. So buying long term government bonds, mortgage backed securities and corporate debt, drives down the supply of those securities. This causes the interest rates to go down as the value of those securities increases (assuming demand in the market remains unchanged).\n",
      "4. Combine government fiscal stimulus with QE, we get massive amounts of money creation while simultaneously keeping interest rates low. A lot of this newly created money funnels into assets causing prices to soar, particularly in the U.S.\n",
      "5. Not only am I a virgin with a small pp but according to the comments I have autism and am a chronic virgin. REEEEEEE \n",
      "\n",
      "# So what happens when the FED begins to taper?  \n",
      "\n",
      "pp poopie, that's what. The short answer is the growth in the money supply should slow down meaning weaker equity performance in 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the FED tapers, it will reduce its QE purchases from 80 billions dollars of U.S. government bonds and 40 billon dollars of mortgage backed securities a month down to nothing. Currently this is set to happen over a 8 month period. So a reduction of 15 billion dollars of purchases a month (10 billion in bonds, 5 billion in mortgage backed securities) will start in December. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now during this entire time, the FED is still increasing the amount of reserves in the banking system and still suppressing interest rates through its purchases. However, we will still see interest rates rise for home loans and corporate debt. For US government debt, I'm too dumb to figure that one out.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mortgage Rates**\n",
      "\n",
      "If we look at the one year chart for home loans we can already see they've been rising. With the FED buying less and less mortgage backed securities during tapering, interest rates should continue to trend upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/0nzvxily7z181.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d1757c43c71be894ee34fb4844e55589d645d62\n",
      "\n",
      "For U.S. treasuries, I don't think we'll see interest rates rise. First, the amount of government deficit spending is dramatically decreasing next year. \n",

      "https://preview.redd.it/12ut6w119z181.png?width=1934&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2cd422bd270487bd802b99e798edc25e6b1ffa\n",
      "\n",
      "This means less government bonds being issued in 2022 ($1.9 trillion less), at the same time the FED will go from buying $960 billions dollars to only $210 billion. We get a staggering $2.74 trillion (3.7 - .96) of net new government bonds on the market in 2021. In 2022 however, only a measly $1.59 trillion (1.8 - .21) of new bonds. If demand for new US treasuries remains the same in 2022, we could actually see a decrease in the interest rates on US treasuries.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Corporate Debt**\n",
      "\n",
      "For junk bonds, interest rates will definitely go up as the FED tapers. The trend has already been accelerating as the FED is no longer purchasing corporate debt. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Would a raise in interest rates, cause equity prices to fall?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising interest rates = less loans due to higher interest costs = slow down in the growth of the money supply\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the rise in interest rates that would cause it but a liquidity crisis of not enough dollars circulating through the system to meet debt payments. So, as an example, there is a risk, rates rise too quickly and zombie corporations can't service their existing debt with new debt. This causes layoffs and some zombie corps to go under, starting a contraction in the credit market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Should that happen, equities will definitely be sold as humans scramble for dollars. This would prompt the FED to stop tapering and increase the amount of QE. Risk is real but ehh\n",

      "# Closing Thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "When I'm in my most retard stupors, I want to be a gay bar and buy puts on the market. However, trying to short the market when the FED is engaged in QE and the US government is engaging in heavy deficit spending is the equivalent to putting your dick in a blender and turning it on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next year we will see a big slow down in the growth of money but there will probably be enough growth in the money supply to fend off a liquidity crisis. If not, FED stops tapering, gets aggressive with QE, US government sends out a stimmy check and it is time to buy those sweet, sweet calls.\n",

The expectations of people returning to the office puts their growth potential in danger.  But I believe the new variant will be a sharp reversal back into pandemic-mode for businesses.

From [The WHO press statement](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern): \"**This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning**. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. Using this approach, **this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage**.\"\n",

      "3:  It can run fucking hard.  This bitch ran from 300 to 475 in a week.  Granted that was due to earnings, but there's precedent for big moves.

      "\\-On Semiconductor Corporation, (ON $44.70) investment thesis is exciting as ON benefits from the growth of the adoption electric vehicles (EVs) over the next decade which is increasing by 7x. Also the growing silicon content per car for ON driven by the electrification and autonomous driving features, which is growing 10x over the next few years to around $1,600 per car. On benefits from the expanding gross margin, profitability, and cash flow that comes from higher volume, lower supply costs, and more efficient manufacturing.  In addition, ON also has significant content in 5G telecom infrastructure and cloud computing applications touching base on all three major macro trends we have identified (5G rollout, cloud computing and EVs).\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-The company stands to benefit from the adoption of EVs over the next 10 years moving from around 12% of total vehicle sales in 2020 to around 62% in 2030.  To put this growth in perspective the US sells around 17 million vehicles per year with the European Union selling around 15 million units and China accounting for about 19-22 million vehicles each year so the market is massive.  At least 25 million more EVs per year will be added to the mix over the next 10 years providing strong unit volume growth of EV's in total and strong growth opportunity for ON.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-ON's current content per car is around $160 and is expected to be over $715 per car in 2022 and to be over $1,500 by 2025 as semiconductor content per car grows dramatically with the adoption of EVs and ADAS or autonomous driving features in cars .  The total semi content per car is expected to grow to over $1,500 by 2025 as both ADAS and EVs drive significant content growth per car for ON.  So the number of EV's sold annually will grow from around 9 million in 2020 to 62 million in 2030 or a 7x increase over a ten year period and the silicon content per car for ON is growing more than 2x over the next 3-4 years driving a double whammy for top line growth for the company.  ON predicts its power business will grow by a CAGR of 15% over the next four years with intelligent sensing business growing by a CAGR of 13% over the same period.  By end market automotive revenue should grow by a CAGR of 17% (versus market growth of around 4-6%) and the industrial market should grow by a CAGR of 7% versus market growth of around 4-5%.  Industrial and automotive make up about 60% of ON's revenue now moving to over 75% by 2025 as the mix shifts into higher margin product lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-ON has around $2,000-$4,000 in content per EV charging station which should be another huge driver of growth as all the EV's sold will need to be charged and with the company's expertise in silicon carbide (SiC) process technology ON should be one of the leaders in SiC applications for both cars (more efficient battery management systems leading to longer travel time) and fast charging, which is now moving to the 20-30 minute range when using SiC chips from ON.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-The company also has exposure to 5G infrastructure and cloud computing with around $300 in content per platform giving ON exposure to all three major macro trends we really like.  The company's content per platform should continue to increase as ON finds new applications with current customers as equipment becomes faster and more sophisticated managing the power flow and consumption becomes ever more critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\-Another thing we like about the ON story is the gross margin expansion opportunities which should mover from 38% to 45% over the next few years and we believe this business can have gross margins in the 48-52% range over the longer term as ON sheds less profitable segments (probably eliminating 10-15% of current sales over the next few years), ON sees a major mix shift to higher margin products in the industrial and automotive segments, the company lowering costs in the supply chain and fab balancing eliminating older less efficient fabs and loading as much as possible into the company's 300mm fab in upstate NY.  All of these actions will drive significant gross margin, cash flow and EPS expansion hopefully making it a successful investment.\n",

      "Deposits are liabilities because the bank owes you that money. On the asset side, the bank holds securities (short term government debt, usually 1-3 months), loans (money to be paid back with interest) and reserves which is basically just cash (digital or physical). A simple way to calculate reserves is to do D - S - L = R. Works most of the time.\n",

      "One other key concept, is the reserve ratio. This is a magic number set by central banks. If the reserve ratio is 10, that means that banks **must** have a minimum of 10% of the total deposits as reserves. So if I have 10,000 dollars in deposits, I must have 1,000 dollars in reserves.\n",

As the money works its way back into the banking system, those new deposits become reserves which can be used to create more loans. Depending on what the reserve requirement is, changes how much the money can be \"multiplied\" by. So a reserve requirement of 10, means we can multiple the base reserves in the system by a factor of 10 (theoretically).

There's quite a bit to this actually but the key takeway here is when the FED lowers the federal funds rate, one action they take is swapping short term securities from banks for reserves. When they raise the federal funds rate, they sell the securities back to the banks and take the reserves. Here is a chart of the Federal Funds Rate over time. (Note, these securities are so short in duration, the FED only has to wait 1 to 3 months for the US government to pay them back and thus, destroy the reserves)\n",

      "\n",
      "As we can see, the federal funds rate has been mostly declining since the 1980s and every time we enter a credit contraction in the credit cycle, we massively cut the federal funds rate. This blunts the credit contraction by increasing bank reserves, lowering interest rates and resuming the increase in credit and debt. Low and behold the graph below.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, in 2008 (or if your Japan 2001), eventually the federal funds rate hits zero and it is time to get serious. Quantitative Easing (QE) is the next step. QE simply allows the central banks to swap what ever they want from a bank's balance sheet for reserves. For example, QE has allowed the FED to gobble up mortgage backed securities. The result is banks loan at lower interest rates in order to get home buyers to take out more/new loans. This result occurs because when a central bank engages in a swap with the bank, the bank loses an asset it was gonna make money on. Now the bank needs to create that asset again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So QE helps keep the credit cycle going by increasing reserves, lowering interest rates and ultimately increasing the amount of credit/money in the system. Now for reasons in a different post, consumer price inflation has remained low despite this all this. However it has arguably caused massive asset inflation, contributing to an ever increase of wealth concentration.\n",

      "**TL/DR:** AAWW made me a millionaire and it is still significantly undervalued. The supply chain disruptions are not easing as fast as recent reports are claiming. Even when they do subside, I expect airfreight rates to remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to evidence of significant pricing power. On top of this, AAWW has done a fantastic job of leveraging current rates for better long-term contract terms. Finally, the rotation from never-profitable companies toward those with sustainable, solid business models is underway and powering AAWW toward a more fair value.\n",

      "\n",
      "* [Supply-Chain Problems Show Signs of Easing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002)\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the statistics I've seen thrown around is that \"[the ports have seen a decline of 33% in aging cargo on the docks](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/california-ports-report-supply-chain-progress-delay-fines-for-lingering-cargo.html).\" But there is a problem here, as the number of ships waiting to unload has actually grown to an all time high today. And call me a conspiracy theorist (I'm not), or a healthy skeptic, but I do not believe one second that \"air quality\" of LA (of all places) is the reason for [requiring ships to wait 150 miles out](https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11). I think it is a fear of the photo ops. No matter the real reason, if the problem is easing why does it matter? And this is during a period in which the backlog supposedly got better, ships were diverted to other ports with less congestion, like Seattle. On a recent drive past the port of Seattle, I was shocked to see how many containers have flooded in. But [now they're out of space](https://theloadstar.com/port-of-seattle-becomes-the-latest-casualty-of-container-congestion/), so I must ask where will the ships currently coming go? To me, it sounds like they'll hop back in line in Cali.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does this matter? Because less ships available means less cargo capacity. Less cargo capacity by ship means more needs to be moved by air. It also means ocean freight rates skyrocket, in turn pushing airfreight rates up dramatically. And based on the above, *I do not believe this is subsiding anytime soon.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 2: The New Era of Air Freight Rates**\n",
      "\n",
      "So we've got significantly boosted earnings for a while to come. But what happens when it eventually subsides? Well, I believe AAWW will continue to reap big profits as airfreight rates will settle well above pre-pandemic rates\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to mention inflation here because there is something interesting here. I believe inflation is playing a feedback loop on airfreight rates. Sure, the act of increasing freight rates is naturally a driver of inflation. But as inflation increases, the giant pool of printed money does not get allocated to every entity (consumer, company, funds, etc) in equal measures. Instead it finds its way to those with more utility or value add. In the context of a laptop, you'll have the foundry that makes semiconductors, the factory that made the plastic shell, the factory that makes the laptop, the store that sold it to you, the shipper that transported it to the store, etc etc. That logistical piece has been long neglected. Now, companies realize how important it is and the natural spending allocation to it will remain increased. I hope I am explaining this theory well enough - I'm happy to elaborate but also don't want to bore you all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors come from AAWW competitors (and customers). Groups like Amazon have [used freight as a loss-leading measure](https://outvio.com/blog/amazon-shipping-policy/) to gobble up market share and capture America in their ecosystem. Airlines used to offer rock bottom rates to fill the belly of aircraft that were already going from Point A to Point B anyways. Both of these will change. In a new inflationary world, companies will be expected to post profit. And Airlines can no longer afford to use freight for small extra cash, as they have very large debts to repay. They'll instead be using airfreight as a core element of their offerings going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and let's not forget - key airfreight rates are to and from China. Pretend for a second that the world is reopening [despite the renewed lockdowns](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/24/germany-considers-a-full-covid-lockdown-and-mandatory-vaccines.html). Do you really think tourism to China and Asia will fill passenger aircraft on those routes? These route-specific dislocations offer massive benefit to companies like AAWW.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Part 3: Locking in Rates**\n",
      "\n",
      "AAWW has also been actively locking in long term contracts at elevated rates. Sure, they don't lock in at rates *this* high, but they still do drive significantly higher long term profits. Lets listen to this gem from the Q3 earnings call:\n",
      "\n",
      ">...But then to get to the duration of these long-term charter contracts, the vast majority of them go into 2022, and 2023. Some of them go into 2024 and 2025. During the quarter, we added an aircraft with a customer for a term of 3.6 years, so it goes through April 2025, at a really good rate. We also extended term with another customer that goes to October 2024, with a higher rate. And so on a fairly regular basis customer's are extending these agreements at higher rates, so we feel good about the long-term charter business. -**Spencer Schwartz,** *Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer*\n",
      "\n",
      "(I can't link this website, you can search for the transcripts of the call.)\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the above, I believe a lot of companies are waiting for \"supply chain issues to ease\" before they negotiate contract extensions. For the reasons I mentioned above above, I think they are on a fool's errand. If I am correct about this, we may see contract renewal rates jump dramatically in Q1-Q2 of next year as a bunch of companies try to all at once, when they see that these freight rates just aren't going down like they're \"supposed to.\" You'll note my significant options allocation to Jan and Feb when I think this will become more evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's do some critical thinking. Contracts with locked in rates are going 2-3.5 years out. AAWW has a P/E of 5.5. Using a DCF model, half of the market cap is paid for, and that is excluding any surge pricing we're getting from the non locked rates over the next few quarters AND the potential for a windfall with even *greater* long-term contract rates. Now *that* is deep fucking value.\n",

Micron’s sales rose from $12 billion in 2016 to $20 billion in 2017 (fueled by data centres and smartphones). In 2017/2018, Mehrota astutely aimed production at solid state drives and graphics. One reason for this was to target the cloud boom, and their upgrade cycle to meet demands for AI applications (making memory important, and thereby putting Micron in a good position). He also aimed to balance between supply and demand that year, rather than the bear market that was indicated by current stock price. In 2017/2018, while expanding investment, Micron built up a cash reserve. It has $8 billion in cash (as of May 2018), and short term investments as of the most recent quarter at that time.

      "Let's say we have a big industrial dairy company called \"Double D Milkshakes\". Double D Milkshakes has lots of large scale industrial farms. In addition, they have facilities that pasteurize the milk. After pasteurizing the milk and bottling it, they then have to transport it to various distributors across the country. \n",
      "\n",
      "This means, that Double D Milkshakes, is sitting on a fucking trove of data. They have data on each individual cow (what feed the cow is being given, how much milk it is producing, the breed, who its mommy and sperm donor daddy is). They also have an immense amount of data on the living conditions the cows are in (such as what temperature the pastures are kept in). Double D Milkshakes also has data on the facilities that pasteurize the milk (lot of sensor data that goes into this). They also  have all kinds of supply chain information and customer information trapped away in horrific ERM and salesforce systems (kill me please).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, every once in a while, some happy, unscarred monkey in management, goes \"Hey, if we can tap into all this data, we could make all kinds of optimizations, increase milk production, reduce cost and oo ee ee\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So this monkey is granted funding, hires idiots like me who can't get jobs at real tech companies and tasks us with centralizing all this data into a data warehouse where the data scientist who are also lower tier can analyze the data and unlock all this value hidden in the data. Here is where it all falls apart. Moving all this data from the corporate farms into a data warehouse proves to be a difficult task. Setting up integration with sales force and all this other siloed data throughout the enterprise also proves to be a rather slow and difficult task. Not to mention, we don't really understand what any of the data means. Two years of your life go by and that gun under the bed starts talking to me every night, saying \"HEY duuddddeeee, don't you think I'd feel good against your template.\" At the same time, half the team has left, the data scientists claim the data is unclean and \"does not make sense\".

      "Here is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. They recognized this problem way back in the early 2000s and thought, \"geez, let's build an entire data platform so people don't have to do that.\" So, low and behold, they built the operating system for data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is what Foundry does:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Foundry can be deployed at the \"edge\". This means at each individual farm and facility that Double D Milkshakes owns, they can deploy foundry to aggregate and collect the data at that location. In addition, workers at these locations can use Foundry to analyze the localized data themselves and make optimizations at the \"edge\". \"But how can these, hard working, illegal immigrants that don't know english do that? Don't you need to be a data scientist?\" Foundry does an excellent job visualizing data. Anyone with actual ambition (illegal immigrants and first gen americans) could figure it out.\n",
      "2. With Foundry deployed at the edge, we can also deploy it at corporate and use all these out of the box integrations to integrate with the various databases, scattered throughout the company. They make it super, duper easy. In addition, all the foundry instances deployed at the edge will send the data they are collecting and analyzing to the main foundry instance\n",
      "3. We can import business ontology to organize the data and actually make sense of it. All this really means, is data often sucks and makes no sense. Foundry allows us to describe what the data means in English and remembers for us. In addition, we can organize the data and foundry makes it easy to clean datasets and do a bunch of other data sciencey crap. The hard part is still figuring out what the data means at first but at least when half the development team leaves for better jobs, the data at that point has already been described and the knowledge will not be lost.\n",
      "4. AI and Machine Learning made simple. Go out and try running machine learning algorithms on large datasets. Takes fucking effort. Foundry makes it so fucking simple that HR can do it.\n",
      "5. Simulations. Probably the biggest fucking win in my book. Building a system to run simulations takes an immense amount of work. Foundry, makes it dead simple. So the workflow becomes this: We import all this data into foundry, describe and organize it. Foundry runs its big brain AI on the datasets and gives us insights, like \"hey dumbo, maybe if we change the feed from feed x to feed y we can increase milk production. I noticed this because one of the farms uses feed y and gets more milk out of those cow tittes.\" We can then simulate what would happen if we changed all of our feed from grain x to y AND see if the cost benefit (because y is more expensive) is worth it.\n",
      "6. A bunch of other shit like alerts, metrics, dashboards, applications can all be created in foundry. \n",

      "I've gone on to long. I do own Palantir at an average cost of $13.06/share. Bought some at IPO and more shortly after. Can't talk to why number goes down. That's for other monkeys to figure out but hopefully this sheeds light on what Palantir does.\n",

      "This is just a train of thought I'd like to share with everyone and hopefully spark a debate about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2007, Chuck Prince of Citigroup famously said of the burgeoning financial crisis: \"As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The music is playing louder than ever, and it seems that we are missing a few seats. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to say it. There are dangerous bubbles that are maturing and growing across several sectors of the economy. The bubbles in the capital markets and in many real estate markets, not to mention the massive inflation of the bubble in the, um, digital 'currency' market, pose significant systemic risks to the global economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bubbles in the capital markets span the whole industry. Equity markets get the most attention, but bond(especially 'high-yield' junk bonds)and commercial paper paper markets are swelling as well. Due to the unprecedented liquidity of equities and other instruments, investors have even more incentive to move their money to the highest performing asset. This excess liquidity, caused by aggressively expansionary monetary policy, in addition to the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020 causing many people to try their hand in the market for the first time has led to a historic boom in the retail equity market and thereby the critical overvaluation of equities. \n",
      "\n",
      "So why is this such a problem? Well, it's complex. In part, it's because these overvalued securities and instruments are used as the basis for more and more lending. That, and these securities are so liquid that they are being used by major banks as cash equivalents to form the \"collateral\", if you will, for higher and higher leverage on larger and larger deals. This in itself is not necessarily destructive, per se, but viewed in the context of a potential shock to the market, it leaves the system very vulnerable to a drop in asset prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "Such a drop could be precipitated by retail and some institutional investors exiting the market en masse in response to some downturn in a dash for cash. Asian markets, led by China, are preparing for markedly slowing growth as part of both a natural business cycle and a dangerously indebted real estate sector. It's no longer unrealistic to forecast a non-negligible recession in East Asia within the next four quarters, and sooner if the property valuation crisis in China does not abate. An unchecked financial crisis in China would certainly pop the bubbles in the West. What exactly would occur next, how it would occur, and the depth of the damage exactly is certainly up for debate, but in such a scenario catastrophic damage and wealth destruction would occur. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moral of the story: something is up. It can't be ignored any longer. The pieces of a crisis are all here; which way will it go? More importantly, how what investment strategies can an average person take today to help offset the increasing risk of a damaging recession?\n",

      "I have recently bought shares in Tilray after hearing that Germany was seriously looking into legalising recreational weed and I Tilray already sell CBD in Germany and have the infrastructure to therefore sell weed if this goes through and it is looking promising but the stock just keeps going down.

      "The Moving average (MA) is one of the most straightforward tools used in Technical Analysis (TA). The moving average is the average price over a time period, we often use the 200 days moving average, 50 days moving average, and the 20 days moving average. It can be used for any timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAs with a shorter timeframe react much faster to price changes. There are also different kinds of Moving Averages used, for example, the SMA (simple moving average) or the EMA (exponential moving average). They differentiate in they behave a little bit. Since this is an introduction, I will not go into further detail here. \n",

      "\n",
      "# The 200-Day (simple) Moving Average (SMA)\n",
      "\n",
      "The 200 SMA represents the average price over the past 200 days. It is mainly used to spot up- and downtrends and also identify support and resistance areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule of thumb, if the price is above the 200 MA, the trend is up; if it's below, the trend is down. \n",
      "\n",
      "# The 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n",
      "\n",
      "This moving average is also very popular under technical traders. It is considered the first line of support in uptrend markets and the first line of resistance if the markets are going down. \n",
      "\n",
      "You may have stumbled across two important terms above: the Death Cross and the Golden Cross. In both turns of trend events, the 200 SMA and the 50 SMA are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "A so-called Death Cross happens if 50 SMA is crossing the 200 SMA from up to down. This is often seen that a bear market is coming up. On the other hand, the Golden Cross is when the 50 SMA crosses the 200 SMA from down to up, good times are supposed to happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "# The 20-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n",
      "\n",
      "The shorter the timeframe, the faster the Moving Averages are reacting to the price changes in the market. With a shorter period, like the average price of 20 days, you can spot changes in trends faster, but it is also more likely that you get a false alarm because of a bit of breakout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving averages are popular within Traders and often used with other key indicators for both, exits and entries. Do not forget you can not predict the future from the past, but you can draw some lines in the sand, get some grip, and better understand price developments. \n",

      "# Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
      "\n",
      "The RSI indicates if a digital asset is overbought or oversold. The Relative Strength Index indicates bullish or bearish price momentum; usually, if the RSI is about 70 %, that means a cryptocurrency is overbought. If the Index is under 30 %, it is oversold. The RSI measures the magnitude of a recent change in the price within a period of time (usually 14 days, 14 hours, etc.). The data are shown on an oscillator between 0 and 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, when the RSI goes below the 70 % level, this can be seen as a bearish signal; on the other hand, if it climbs above 30 %, this can be seen as a bullish sign. A momentum indicator like the RSI can give an idea if buyers have the market under control or sellers might take over. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like all other indicators and financial metrics, the signals can be misleading, so it is best not to use them as a direct sell and buy signals. \n",

      "# Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)\n",
      "\n",
      "The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator. It subtracts the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA and measures the relationship between two EMA's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is made up of two lines. There is the MACD line and the signal line. Most charting tools (e.g., Tradingview ) also show a histogram showing the distance between the signal and the MACD line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traders can get an insight into the strength of the current trend by looking at the MACD chart. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the price chart shows higher highs, but the MACD shows lower highs, there is a higher probability that the markets could start going down soon. The price is increasing while the momentum is decreasing.\n",
      "\n",
      " Momentum is the speed or velocity of an Asset's price change \n",
      "\n",

      "Electric car sales have been growing but the vast majority of cars and trucks still remain gas powered. The main economic problem that companies face with EV’s is the cost of the battery and sub-par performance in comparison to gas cars. Many car companies have committed to switching over to EVs and some are even abandoning combustible engines all together, such as Tesla. There is a large consolidation in the battery space with most of the biggest players belonging to foreign markets such as Korea, China and Japan. Quantumscape is an American startup with backing from Bill Gates and Volkswagen group. \n",
      "\n",
      "Quantumscape utilizes new solid state lithium anode batteries to outcompete standard batteries.  They do this in a variety of ways including cost of inputs, energy density, charging time, and battery cycles. There are 3 important values that batteries in today's market need to be competitive: Charge time, energy density, and number of battery cycles (or length of battery life). \n",
      "\n",
      "Solid state batteries last for more charge cycles and offer a higher energy density than traditional car batteries, this is possible because of QS’s advancement in lithium anode batteries. Lithium anode batteries require less rare earth metals such as cobalt and lithium because these batteries completely lack cathodes (which is achievable with a solid as an electrolyte). Additionally, SSB’s are much faster charging compared to lithium-ion batteries, charging to 80% in just 15 minutes. All of these factors are critically important in engineering a more economically and commercially viable battery for mass consumer adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/ctbpqtgiqe181.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d43d4d710a28519581488300fced0d33d8f2174\n",
      "\n",
      "Lithium ion batteries are passable in energy density and battery cycles but currently lack a way to charge really fast, making charge times take hours. The Quantumscape engineers see that one major bottleneck for all of these features is in the layout of lithium-ion batteries. Solid state batteries are their solution to these bottlenecks. To achieve this feat QS must learn how to mass produce both the solid electrolyte and solid state batteries inside of one giga-factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantumscape has been developing its first high-volume automated factory called QS-0. This makes Quantumscape inch ever closer to commercialization of their products including the 10-layer cell. Future growth in demand for batteries makes now the best time for suppliers to develop their infrastructure to increase output.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/fzadkeujqe181.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f9b92b5d012e71f0bb96dafd37a881918b80727\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantumscape has a large cash cushion and a rather small operating budget. Cash operating expenses are about $130 million to $160 million with around $1.3 billion in liquidity. The $1.3 billion is expected to carry the company through QS-1 initial production and expansion. This is a hit or miss scenario, the $1.3 billion could last them all the way past their initial factory or until QS commercializes their products by 2024. Short term cash flow could come from selling stock and watering down holders shares to cover QS-2 if they don’t have strong sales. \n",
      "\n",
      "The race of Solid-state batteries has been going on for years between multiple companies. The main problem is the solid electrolyte separator; many different designs over the years have been proposed yet failed. A solid electrolyte needs to account for three factors: conductivity of lithium ions (think fast charge), corrosion (of battery dendrites) , and the chemical and electrochemical stability of lithium metal. These three necessities have stumped the best chemists looking to create a solid battery. QS is still early in the development of their factory output and product. This is a risky company in our portfolio, they have a time limit to becoming a viable company with marketable batteries. As of right now Qs has the best likelihood of progressing the technology of solid-state batteries. QS batteries are just a prototype currently, but their prototype has 36% more capacity and charges twice as fast as leading EV batteries, like tesla’s. \n",
      "\n",
      "QS has huge potential. It seems likely they will take a huge bit out of the $300 billion battery market. Their technology scales down in size very well, in fact the tests they are conducting are on batteries small enough to fit in a phone. We've personally made great returns on this name, over 50%, and think it has a lot of room to run. If they can pull everything off, they have a strictly better battery with 36% more capacity, charging that is twice as fast, and a longer effective life than the current leading batteries. Revenue for this company could be as high as $100 billion/ year in 1- years. This position is high risk, high reward.\n",

      " InPlay Oil (OTCQX:IPOOF) is a small Canadian oil and gas producer currently working on a transformational acquisition with a smaller company called Prairie Storm Resources. The combination of both entities will create economies of scale and synergy benefits.\n",

      "\n",
      " I would strongly recommend to trade in InPlay Oil using the company’s primary listing in Canada, where it’s trading with IPO as its ticker symbol. The current share price is C$2.11, giving the company a market capitalization of around C$144M. The average daily volume in Canada is in excess of a 250,000 shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Q3 was strong \n",
      "\n",
      "In this article I will use a two-pronged approach. In this section I’ll explain why InPlay Oil is actually reasonably valued on a standalone basis, and in the next section I will discuss the planned acquisition of a smaller \"competitor\" which will further boost InPlay’s results.\n",
      "\n",
      "InPlay Oil produced on average 6,011 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in the third quarter, of which approximately 55% actually consisted of oil. The attributable production has increased by more than 50% since Q3 2020 as InPlay is taking advantage of the strong oil and gas price to boost its output. During the quarter, the company received just under C$76/barrel of oil and just under C$3.89 for its natural gas, compared to respectively C$39.5 and C$2.32 in Q3 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "This resulted in a total revenue of C$27M after deducting the royalties and the small loss on derivatives. As you also notice in the image below, InPlay is a low-cost producer as the company reported a pre-tax income and a net income of just under C$8.3M for the quarter.\n",

      "\n",
      "Source: financial statements\n",
      "\n",
      "You can clearly see almost half of the total expenses are related to depreciation and amortization expenses, so the \"pure\" production costs are pretty low.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to spend too much time on the income statement as in the oil and gas sector, I’m mainly interested in how much cash flow a company is making. After all, the cash flow will fund the sustaining and growth capex.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most recent quarter, InPlay reported an operating cash flow of C$15M before working capital changes, but after deducting the lease payments. The total capex was just around C$10.5M, resulting in a free cash flow of C$4.5M.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Source: financial statements\n",
      "\n",
      "As the total capex was about 40% higher than the depreciation and amortization charges, and as almost 40% of the 9M 2021 capex was spent in just one quarter, InPlay Oil was clearly investing cash in accelerating its growth as the company wants to further boost its output to meet its 2022 guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the end of September, InPlay Oil had a net debt of approximately C$66M which will increase upon completing the acquisition of Prairie Storm. But that’s just temporary as InPlay is guiding for the net debt to fall off a cliff in 2022 using US$70 WTI and C$3.70 AECO.\n",
      "\n",
      "# The acquisition of Prairie Storm will kick start the 2022 results \n",
      "\n",
      "In September, Prairie Storm agreed to be acquired by InPlay Oil for a total consideration of C$0.2514 in cash and 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil. At the current share price of C$2.11 of InPlay Oil, the total value of the offer is C$0.2514 + C$0.1106 = C$0.362/share which means Prairie’s current share price of C$0.35 is trading below the implied offered price. InPlay will be paying a total of C$40M in cash and issue about 8.3 million new shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have the impression the market didn’t fully understand the deal as some sellers sold Prairie Storm shares below C$0.30. I was able to scoop up some shares at C$0.30 and C$0.305 for an average of C$0.3025, and this means that for every 10,000 shares of Prairie Storm I own, I will effectively pay C$0.0511 per 0.0524 shares of InPlay Oil, which represents approximately C$0.98/share. That arbitrage opportunity now no longer exists, but one could always try to put in a buy order at C$0.325 for Prairie Storm as that would allow you to acquire InPlay Oil at C$1.56.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arbitrage gap no longer really exists, but the InPlay-Prairie Storm deal makes sense on several levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an initial round of drilling, InPlay Oil expects the Prairie Storm assets to report an average production of 2,755 boe/day in 2022, resulting in about C$31-33M of operating income and C$16.5-18.5M of free adjusted funds flow. And thanks to the very low decline rate of just around 10% on the Prairie Storm assets, the sustaining capex required to keep the production rate stable will be rather minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acquisition allowed InPlay to hike its 2022 guidance to a total production of 9,150 boe/day (the midpoint of the 8,900-9,400 boe/day guidance) resulting in a consolidated adjusted funds flow of around C$110M.\n",

      "\n",
      "The total capex budget for 2022 is now estimated at approximately C$52M which would result in a net free cash flow of approximately C$55-59M. This will reduce the net debt to just around C$20-25M by the end of 2022, making InPlay Oil a very healthy small-scale producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And investors should be aware the guidance above is based on US$69.75 WTI and C$3.70 AECO. The spot prices are currently quite a bit higher so perhaps InPlay Oil could beat its guidance. But for now, let’s just use the official guidance, as we can always fine tune our expectations in 2022 once we see how the oil and gas prices are behaving.\n",

      "The acquisition makes InPlay Oil cheap on basically any metric. Assuming the company’s base case scenario is credible, InPlay Oil will generate in excess of C$0.60/share in free cash flow in 2022, which makes the current share price of C$2.11 still a steal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil and gas companies are taking advantage of huge tailwinds right now, and using the current strip prices, InPlay could actually be debt-free by the end of next year, in which case a C$170M market cap for a company generating in excess of C$55M in free cash flow is outrageously low.\n",
      "\n",
      "I currently don’t have a position in InPlay Oil, but I have a long position in Prairie Storm and I expect to end up with a long position in InPlay Oil once the transaction closes.\n",

      "Quantum computing in the near future will usher in huge advances in technology and perhaps transform how we go about our daily lives for the better. The unfortunate part of our quantum future is that when quantum computing arrives, current encryption methods keeping all of our information safe, will fail. This is not a question of if, it is of when. The Global Risk Institute released a report titled \"Quantum Threat Timeline\" in 2019 which polled 22 leading data scientists on the forecasted timetable for a quantum computer to break current encryption standards. The consensus at the time was around 15 years, or 2034. Since that report was released, the quantum computing market has experienced a massive surge of investment with incredibly fast progress reported from companies around the globe, several, such as Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Rigetti Computing and Honeywell (HON) already have broken past 100 qubits, with a rapid doubling of capability shown.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "For reference, a recent article from Cornell University shows that PKI encryption (the current industry standard) may require as little as 2,000 logical qubits to break, making the timeline for current encryptions' obsolescence disturbingly close, likely in the 2025-2030 time frame, with governments such as the USA, UK, China and Russia likely well ahead of that date. A troubling trend noted recently by nation-state actors is to \"harvest now, decrypt later\" which is the term for stealing encrypted data from hardened sources today and then store the data to decrypt when the technology is available.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "It has even been theorized that the entire chain that digital assets depend on may be at risk of total hijack or collapse once quantum computers reach maturity. This trend makes it critically important for nations to migrate away from PKI encryption as soon as possible to symmetric encryption keys. The biggest problem currently with symmetric key encryption is that you need to have a way to get the key to the other party with whom you are sharing the data. Arqit believes that it has a solution for this critical problem that is completely computationally secure, which means it cannot be broken by any current or future machine, along with a delivery system that cannot be intercepted via the quantum cloud. The key to this entire technology's eventual adoption is that the algorithm used is already the global standard (AES), meaning that it is operable with current systems, giving users no logical reason to not adopt the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The technology Arqit invented is covered by over 1,400 patent claims making this company and its technology potentially protected from copycats looking to set up similar business models for some time to come. The commercial strategy also appears to be very well thought out, with the software downloaded by customers and used automatically. Billing events are created by usage via commercial customers with key creation events being metered. The brilliance of this strategy is the incredibly low capex Arqit has to expend once the core infrastructure is in place, as the software needed is basically zero touch.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "With current systems operating on a compatible format, ultimately every connected device is a potential customer of Arqit without the need of the company building any further infrastructure as the 2 planned and paid for satellites used are able to generate two quadrillion unique keys per year. To get an idea of the explosive potential of this company, please keep in mind that the below pipeline and business development was accomplished all in 2021, with only 2 dedicated salespeople, one being the CEO himself.To land executed, recurring and framework contracts with the likes of the British Government, British Telecom (OTCPK:BTGOF), Sumitomo Corporation (OTCPK:SSUMF) ESA and Dentons in addition to an \"unnamed\" major payment network, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Iridium (IRDM), Verizon (VZ) and BP (BP) accomplished pre hard rollout is unbelievably impressive and gives credibility to the massive potential ahead for the company.\n",

      "During recent analyst conferences before the de-SPAC event, the CEO has reported massively increased interest in the product well before any ramp up in sales and marketing efforts by the company. Generally I do not like to discuss financial projections generated from the SPAC process as many companies simply throw hopes and dreams into a blender to come up with these. However, given the solid and proven pipeline of customers Arqit has signed already and the fact that the service is already live give me enough confidence to share the company's 2025 projections.With Arqit, I really have to control my enthusiasm a bit, not only does the company appear to have a scalable solution to a massive problem affecting nearly every sector around the globe, but the company also has a way of doing it that is low capex and very high margin.\n",

      "In addition, the company having expended basically zero sales effort to date, has secured $130 million in guaranteed revenues from A list customers with a high probability of closing a $1.1 billion backlog pipeline already. The CEO indicated in the recent investor day that in his 30 years of sales experience, he has never had any product like Arqit's and that his closing percentage is nearly 100%. If Arqit even comes close to the financial projections they have presented, which the CEO notes is a very conservative projection, then the company could be worth many multiples of the current $2.1\n",

In late August I purchased a moderately sized speculative position in the SPAC. My only hesitancy in purchasing more is that generally, when a company seems to have a no-brainer, hugely profitable solution to a massive problem, red flags tend to appear.\n",

I am very excited to see how this company develops as it would appear they may have solved a truly massive problem that nearly all NATO countries have been losing sleep over for years, before it actually existed.

      "Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc., (KLIC $57.07) reported September quarter results that were better than initial expectations and guided the December quarter to be above street estimates as the core wire bonder business is performing a bit better than expected given the drop in IC unit volume growth. KLIC is seeing upside to other segments such as high-end LED, advanced packaging tools for thermal compression bonding, and growing opportunities in the automotive segment with power management chips and battery assembly applications.  Over the next couple of years the company's LED pick and place tool could drive revenue in this segment to be over $300 million from around $80 million in FY2021 establishing KLIC with another major growth driver.  The new LED tool addresses more applications besides just final placement including sorting, binning, and adjusting the LEDs on the substrate and is expected to drive much broader customer adoption outside of the initial customer who we believe is Apple. We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company reported September (Q4FY2021) revenue of $485.3 million up 14.4% sequentially and up 173% versus last year's September quarter and in-line with the company's pre-release of results on November 1, 2021.  Revenue was better than initial estimates driven by strength in general semiconductor, memory and LED revenue coming in at the high end above $80 million for the year. Gross margin was 47.7% up from the 46.1% reported last quarter driven by volume, mix, cost reductions, and ASP increases. Operating profit was a record 31.9% up from 28.4% reported last quarter and the 13.0% reported in last year's September quarter. Pro-forma EPS was $2.17 up from the $1.87 reported last quarter and the $0.35 reported in last year's September quarter and in-line with the pre-released EPS estimate of $2.15-$2.17.\n",

      "KLIC generated $123 million in cash flow from operations and total cash increased $105 million sequential to $740 million or $11.63 in net cash per share up from the $10.00 in net cash reported last quarter as KLIC continues to be a cash generating machine.  Increasing cash by $4.15 per share over the last twelve months\n",
      "\n",
      "KLIC's reported FY2021 revenue of $1.52 billion up 144% in versus FY2020 and better than the company's initial $1.50 billion estimate driven by much higher IC unit volume growth in 2021 driving the company's core wire bonder business significantly higher servicing the 5G, EV's, and increasing content and complexity of each IC.  Strong growth in LED displays, service and the automotive recovery also helped revenue growth for the year. Operating income was $412.4 million or 27.2% of revenue in FY2021 up from the 9.4% reported in FY2020 driving huge EPS growth of 482% to $6.14 propelled by the increase in revenue and tight operating expense control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company guided December quarter (Q1FY2022) revenue to be $460 million down 5.2% sequentially and up 73% versus last year and better than the street's $411.7 million estimate driven by another strong LED display quarter and less of a decline in the core wire bonder business than initially anticipated.  Gross margin should be around 47% down slightly from the 47.7% reported last quarter. Pro-forma EPS should be $1.88 +/- 10% down from the $2.17 just reported and up from the $0.86 reported last year and better than the street's $1.54 estimate driven by the higher revenue and gross margin. \n",
      "\n",
      "KLIC did not update the $1.5 billion revenue estimate for FY2022 (flat with the $1.52 billion just reported in FY2021) but did suggest we might now have a bit of upside to that number as the core wire bonder business declines a bit in calendar 2022 as overall unit volume growth slows from over 20% in 2021 to around 8-10% in 2022.  This decline of around $150-$200 million in core wire bonding revenue in 2022 will be offset by growth in the company's other segments of high-end LED, advanced packaging focused on thermal compression bonding with a large OEM who we believe is Intel, new opportunities in automotive battery assembly and power management segments with customers such as Tesla and increased service revenue producing flat revenue for the year, or as we are forecasting, moderate growth for FY2022 to near $1.6 billion.  Expanding gross margin and operating leverage should produce higher EPS on flat revenue in FY2022. We are now forecasting pro-forma EPS of $6.34 in FY2022 up from the $6.14 just reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would be adding to positions of KLIC at current valuations with a move to the $105 range of 15x our FY2022 pro-forma EPS of $6.34 plus the $11.63 in net cash.  In the near term the core wire bonder business will drop a bit in 2022 but then probably start to grow again in 2023 as increased IC unit volume growth drives up the core business again. The ramp of the LED display business from $80 million to over $100 million in 2022 and the ramp up of new advanced packaging products, in the back half of 2022 in the thermal compression bonding segment, which should double from the $20 million range to over $40 million in 2023 and $80 million in 2024, and growing automotive and battery assembly revenue should allow KLIC to show slight revenue growth in 2022 and higher revenue growth above $1.5 billion in 2023 and 2024 pushing the stock to over $100.\n",

US had put a hold on INO Phase 3 back in Sept of 2020 (SMH- No idea why) but has recently lifted the hold... Phase 3 is a case driven trial based on what I heard from the CEO on the earnings call once 75 confirmed covid cases have been reached the study would be unblinded... so the efficacy data might come out sooner than expected... the company does say that they expect efficacy readout to be by or before 2H of 2022. The company plans to apply for EUA in all of the countries where the trial is being conducted... INO could be the go to booster that we seem to need with this disease ...and unfortunately Covid will be endemic ... WHO is also conducting a solidarity trial of INO-4800 (INO was chosen 2 out of out of 20 candidates) in Philippines and Columbia ( at different sites)\n",

INO 5401 - Phase Trial has been going really well and INO might be kicking this hard to treat cancer's (GBM) ass - This above all is a good reason to be bullish... the data that has been shared thus far looks great...

      "Hello, fellow apes just thought I'd share some DD with you and would love your input and discussions. Now all of you have probably heard of Snapchat, the app your girlfriend uses when she is talking to her boyfriend. I've decided to look into the stock after the plunge it took recently. Allow me to break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bullish Assumptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Using [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) I was able to find some useful info. Out of all institutions holding 449/860 increased positions, 302/860 decreased positions, and 109/860 held positions. 62 funds closed positions entirely while 158 funds entered into new positions. Overall, there are many more shares being bought and held than shares being sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue has been steadily growing YoY and EPS (albeit negative) are moving towards positive territory. Keep in mind also that SNAP spends almost its entire revenues on research and development due to the fact that the company is still very young. \n",
      "\n",
      "SNAP also has a unique and unparalleled ability to attract younger users, but here is the catch. They retain these users much better than other social media platforms. Many of the younger users also are using snap primarily as a form of texting, not just sending selfies back and forth. The app is honestly more flexible than most analysts give credit for. SNAP could also benefit from the metaverse thesis and their R&D expenses may be indicative that they are already on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bearish Cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Although SNAP is growing as a company the social media space is more competitive than ever, especially with the metaverse hype. Other competitors could potentially pull market share away from SNAP and onto their own platform. Additionally, social media is relatively new and like previous platforms, we can not predict with reasonable accuracy that a disruptive technology renders our current useless. \n",
      "\n",
      "Negative Earnings: A double-edged sword. As stated previously SNAP has a negative EPS and therefore implies that the stock is much higher risk compared to a positive EPS low PE company. (respectively, you aren't on this thread looking for low-risk slow-growing assets though)\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the current price level and company performance I don't see why SNAP wouldn't rebound. The company is highly innovative, retains users well, and is flexible. Financials are improving and it appears that management has good control over financial metrics. For transparency's sake, I am holding 240 shares @ 51.09 AVG, 3 Jan 20, 2023, $50 Strike Calls, and 2 Jan 20, 2023, $60 Strike calls. I  know this isn't a massive position but I believe in entering slowly and will be accumulating over the next 5 months. I believe given the right market environment this stock could reasonably be at $65/share by the end of next year. Also, this is not financial advice and I always advocate investing according to your own goals. \n",

Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.\n",

      "Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "*“And once they do—we think the stock action could be fast,” Muse wrote. “We also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.”*\n",
      "*Other reasons for the climb:*\n",

      "* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving “due to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google”. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.\n",

It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC’s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase.

The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).\n",

In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. \n",
      "Another important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. \n",

      "“Today we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse\n",
      "\n",
      "2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges\n",
      "\n",
      "3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”\n",

Let’s start off with the basic financial rundown, HIMS will do 263-265 million dollars in revenue meaning that they’re trading at a P/S of about 5.2, much lower than TDOC’s 8.5 not to mention that HIMS is just a 1.4 billion dollar company while TDOC is over 17.4 billion, now, this alone does not justify a higher multiple but wait till I get to the growth. \n",

      "HIMS has grown revenue 64% YoY with an INSANE gross margin of 76% which grew another 3% YoY. Once again, let’s compare it to TDOC who is their closest competitor in this space although it is important to note that TDOC is B-B while HIMS is B-C. TDOC’s gross margin was 67.3% therefore once again justifying a higher multiple for HIMS. \n",

      "\n",
      "“ While Hims & Hers does not believe there are currently any direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions and direct-to-consumer touch points as it does, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address chronic conditions that compete with Hims & Hers’ solutions.\n",

      "•\n",
      "\n",
      "In direct-to-consumer healthcare, Hims & Hers’ competition is largely fragmented and consists of many competitors that are smaller in scale and/or are more niche in focus with respect to the conditions they treat.

      "\n",
      "Quick Note, the TAM is 121 billion dollars, that’s insane. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another very nice aspect of this company is that they have over 252 million dollars in cash which is continuing to grow at an extremely fast rate YoY. I absolutely love this aspect of the company as well because for such as small company having such a large cash supply, in ensures they won’t issue more shares and it helps with any additional acquisitions to fuel their growth. \n",

Growth in Subscriptions was driven by increased customer conversion rates from improved onsite and customer onboarding experiences, increased customer engagement with our marketing campaigns, increased retention rates of existing subscribers (also referred to as “members”), increased marketing expenses, and the addition of Subscriptions from the acquisitions of Apostrophe and HHL. As a result of growth in Subscriptions, we generated approximately 968,000 Net Orders, an increase of 66% as compared to approximately 582,000 Net Orders for the three months ended September 30, 2020. We generated approximately 2.4 million Net Orders, an increase of 44% as compared to approximately 1.7 million Net Orders for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.”\n",

      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* \n",
      "\n",
      "**Brief Synopsis:** \n",
      "\n",
      "SNAP the self-proclaimed camera company is the de-facto founder and ruler of the Meta-world. The technologies developed by SNAP over the years have been game changer in almost all aspects and have been shamelessly copied by the major social media players. Snapchat launched the filters, stories, spotlight, in app games, social maps and many more paving the way for Snapchat being arguably the most preferred social media in the 13-24 year (90%) and 13-34 year (75%) population.\n",
      "\n",
      "SNAP has also been well received by the product companies. Their AR (Augmented Reality) technology is far superior than any of the competition that is around. The AR helps the users to try the products (apparel and accessories) and gives them more confidence about product fit and quality. This also reduces returns to a great extent and is preferred by the manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The current issue pulling the stock price down:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple’s new privacy feature that allows the user to turn off tracking has affected the targeted advertising. This has increased the cost of acquiring sale through ads in Snap and all other mobile based advertising platforms. This move has adversely affected the earnings of SNAP and it missed their own lower end of the guidance in Q3 by $3 Mn. In the words of the CEO/Founder, Evan Spiegel, “While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS”. \n",
      "\n",
      "**How will SNAP tackle this?**\n",
      "\n",
      "But the important part here is what Evan Spiegel later said during the Q&A of the earning’s call, “This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us, but I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users is really important for the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support”. In the current environment it is really meaningful of a CEO to recognize this and find a way to monetize with these limitations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, when the supply chain issues start to resolve, maybe post the holiday period, advertisement revenue will pick up once again, mainly in SNAP (among social media); why? because of SNAP’s incredible AR technology, its metaverse model and the user group that values its privacy and which fully utilizes the AR world. Recent brands that have started using SNAP’s AR technology to target user groups include Samsung (for their wearable), Hollister, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, HBO Max (through co-watching experience).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Financial Performance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "SNAP has been proving itself to investors consistently. Just looking at their numbers will prove how incredible they have been. **Heads UP:** They have not yet made a profit. But they are on the way to being mighty profitable. **Take a look at their key numbers and make a decision for yourself.** This is a long term play.\n",

Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

If I’m bullish or bearish on either company, I should look to enter a $DG position BEFORE $DLTR reports since the $DLTR report will move $DG a comparable amount. By playing $DG we can avoid IV crush but still cash in on our gains if we’re correct. More info on this type of play can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n",

Similar to $FL last week, $PDD reports on Friday, meaning that theta will murder the value of the options, allowing us to get in cheaper than we would normally be able to. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate, the options will be pricing a move closer to 8% come Friday, meaning we’ve got huge edge in this trade. If the numbers are still appealing come Wednesday afternoon (markets are closed Thursday), I will run a long straddle.

      "\n",
      "MARA has gone through the ringer over the past couple of weeks caused by a series of unfortunate events. Firstly, on November 10th, 2021, MARA reported their Q3 2021 earnings report in which they beat their earnings estimate, but missed on revenue, however with revenue rising 6,000% YoY (for Q3), surely MARA would go up right? Wrong. MARA dipped on this earnings (about 14%) which was objectively the least of investors concerns after the next couple of events to unfold. 5 days after their earnings, MARA announced that they were being investigated by the SEC for securities law violations. This news (combined with the news of a $500M debt offering) caused MARA to drop by 27%, which was by far the largest drop/worry for investors. Lastly, to top it all off, the next day MARA reported that they increased their debt offering to $650M (from $500M), causing the stock to dip another 8% to put the cherry on top of an awful week.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article seeks to find whether MARA is a good buy after their -28% week, or if they are still overvalued and could continue falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MARA Company Overview:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Marathon Digital Holdings is a mining company that was founded in 2010 and headquartered in Las Vegas. As of Q3 2021, MARA had 25,272 miners installed and mining , and 4,000 additional miners being shipped and awaiting installment. Furthermore, MARA has purchase agreements with Bitmain to purchase over 100,000 more miners and install them by January 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MARA Investment Information:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Shares Outstanding Historical Growth:*\n",
      "\n",
      "MARA has increased their shares outstanding by a CAGR of 160% over the last 4 years. This is arguably the highest CAGR in shares outstanding that I have ever seen and is heavily influenced by their share offerings in 2020, which increased the shares outstanding by a factor of 7x within 1 year. However, since the Q1 2021 report, MARA has only increased their shares outstanding by approximately 4%. This desire to maintain their current level of shares outstanding can be exhibited through their recent offering, in which they financed using debt instead of equity (which they have not opted for historically). I think that MARA is going to severely decline their share offerings, and I believe that share dilution is not currently worrisome for MARA investors, however it should be kept in the back of your mind and paid attention to.\n",
      "\n",
      "*$650M Debt Offering:*\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously mentioned, MARA had a $650M debt offering on November 17th 2021, which played a major role in their 28% decline. However, was this reaction warranted? Or was it an overreaction? Let’s find out.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARA announced that they would be issuing $650M worth of 1% convertible senior notes due December 1st, 2026. MARA was able to secure this funding by offering interest of 1% which is very low for a company that does not have a published S&P Credit Score. However, the big opportunity here lies in the convertibility of these notes. These notes will be convertible as early as June 1st, 2026, in which holders can convert their notes into 13.13 shares for every $1,000 worth of bonds that they hold. The math works out to roughly 1 share for every $76 they invested in notes. This was roughly the price of their stock before it dropped 28%. However, if there are large movements in their stock, MARA has the right (under certain circumstances) to change the conversion rate of these notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "MARA intends to use the proceeds of this offering to acquire mining machines. Based off of their previous purchases it is safe to assume that MARA will be using part of these proceeds to purchase ASIC Antminer S-19j miners (given that their big orders have been these models of miners historically). Given that the current price for one of these miners is $12,000, given current price of $60,000 USD, each of these machines is expected to breakeven in 1 year (after housing and electricity each machine should yield $12,630/year (USD)). However, MARA has historically been able to obtain a 6% discount due to high volume orders, bringing their price per miner to approximately $11,250. In their recent Q3 2021 investor presentation they estimated the return on invested capital is 109% annually, which matches up with the figures I found. Considering this return on invested capital (when purchasing miners), this offering should be beneficial for investors in the long run. Especially if you load up at current prices or after this bull run is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Environmental Social and Governance:*\n",
      "\n",
      "Mining has been heavily criticized by the public, the media, and large public figures like Elon Musk for consuming large amounts of electricity, thereby polluting the environment. This is a problem that few miners have addressed, however, MARA has pledged to becoming 70% carbon neutral by Q1 2022, and 100% carbon neutral by Q1 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have not laid out a plan on how they intend to do this, and there is not one that I can find online, so time will tell. However, I believe this to be in their best interest to attract more institutional investors, and more conscious retail investors as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Institutional Investors:*\n",
      "\n",
      "Marathon Digital has piqued the interest of many institutional investors as of late. Currently they have 10 institutional investors, with the likes of Vanguard, and Blackrock having large stakes (8.8%, and 5.8% respectively). Furthermore, in their Q3 institutional investors disclosure, they reported 8 of their 10 institutional holders increased their position sizes, notably Goldman Sachs increased their position size by over 600%, and Charles Schwab increased their position size by 188%. Furthermore, there were only 2 holders that decreased their position sizes, who were Northern Trust (decreased by 2.3%), and BlackRock (who decreased their position size by 2.1%).\n",
      "\n",
      "*HODL’ing:*\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the start of the bull run around January of 2021, MARA has been increasing the % of mined that they are holding. In January of 2021, MARA held 3.5% of their mined coins, however, as of October 2021, MARA is holding 35% of their minings. Currently, MARA is holding 7,453 coins which equates to roughly $450M USD of liquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Expansion and Growth Plans:*\n",
      "\n",
      "Between now and mid-2022, MARA plans to have all of their 133,000 ordered miners deployed and running, which should increase their generating capacity by almost 400%. I do not believe that this includes the miners that are going to be purchased as a result of their debt offering, however it is unclear, and I am hoping that they will announce more details on where they spent the proceeds of this debt offering soon. MARA plans to get all of these miners up and running by mid-2022, as they are going to start to charter their own flights to ensure that they can receive these miners in a timely manner. Furthermore, I believe that MARA has already reached an agreement with a facility to enable them to run these additional 100,000 miners for ($0.50/miner per day) $18.25M/year. However, given their current profitability these miners should drive in $1.26B in revenue/year.­\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investment Valuation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way in which I was able to value MARA was through a comparable companies analysis. This is due to the fact that MARA is not yet profitable, and they do not offer a dividend.\n",
      "\n",
      "*P/B Ratio:*\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparing MARA’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found their fair value to be $45/share, which would imply a price reduction of 18%.\n",
      "\n",
      "*EV/Assets Multiple:*\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparing MARA’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competition, I found MARA’s fair value to be $38.50/share, which implies a downside risk of 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "*D/E Ratio:*\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, by comparing MARA’s D/E ratio, I found their fair value to be $820/share, which implies an increase of 1400%.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Final Valuation:*\n",

In order to value MARA, I decided to take a weighted average result of the 3 comparable metrics, giving weights of 45%, 45%, and 5% to the P/B, EV/Assets, and D/E Ratios respectively.

Furthermore, I would be looking to slowly accumulate more MARA after this bull run is over to get in at a low price and hold for the next 4 years until the next halving and bull run.\n",

This makes sense as they exploded higher will small caps from the end of last year into early this year, but they're now looking at a possible failed breakout like IWM / /RTY.

      "\n",
      "Even though MU lost 1.3% since the start of June (and competitor Lam has fallen 0.8%, while the Semiconductor index has increased 22.8% in the same time frame), Muse confidently states that “..it is clear that the tides are shifting, with pricing decline expectations into 1HCY22 becoming ‘less bad,’ estimates likely bottoming in 1H22, and green shoots arising from PC constraints elsewhere easing, and hyperscale capex spend likely improving before year end. Thus, we think it is game on for memory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From an investor positioning perspective, we note investors are generally eager to get back into memory for anticipated outperformance in 2022 but are not there today,” Muse wrote. “So when the turn comes, we think it will be fast and furious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from EverCore, there are other financial analysts who believe MU is poised to take advantage of the future of memory. Citi analyst Christopher Danely notes that the firm's DRAM analyst Peter Lee recently raised his DRAM pricing expectations for Q4 of 2021 and Q1 of 2022, driven mostly by upside from the PC end market, which led the DRAM correction. Channel checks indicate there has been some upside from the PC market for DRAM and demand from the server end market for Q1 of 2022 appears to be better than expected, Danely tells investors in a research note. As such, the analyst expects \"more positive catalysts\" for DRAM in the coming months and initiated a \"positive catalyst watch\" on Buy-rated Micron. He expects the stock to trade higher as investors gain more confidence the DRAM correction \"is drawing to a close.\" Danely keeps a $120 price target on the stock, currently trading just north of $80 a share.  \n",

In addition to eps miss, small cap stocks have also been beaten down the past couple of weeks dropping FUBO to a price of $21.50 at Fridays close.

As long as a company does not run into issues operationally they should pop after earnings. The moment a company mentions supply chain issues, the market punishes them severely mostly because if they have issues now then they would have more issues during holiday season when higher volume of merchandise is needed. Moreover, most retailers make most of their money during holiday season. Markets are forward-looking and want assurance that companies will have the goods for the next 6 weeks. \n",

Even if they open +2% \\~ +4% (which I think will happen) they are worth considering. I would stay away from Burlington, Urban outfitters, and Guess. Burlington is targeting less affluent clients than Nordstrom. Urban outfitters as a lot of operational issues that make it less able to execute compared to American Eagle or Abercrombie. Guess has more European clients than Gap. I expect Gap to run up on Tuesday if AEO or ANF report good numbers. If Guess runs up as well I may short it as a hedge for a potential Gap trade. \n",

      "Now for some real ANALysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) $OPEN's business is a structurally flawed highly leveraged hedge fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open door takes capital, buys assets, and attempts to resell at a profit. Ignoring whether their skill at selling at a profit or not, they do NOT have enough capital on hand to actually buy these houses for cash, so they take on mortgages. What's worse, they take on SHORT TERM mortgages. As of Q3 $4B out of $5.3B of mortgage debt (backing $6.3B of real estate inventory) is due within one year. Why? To lower holding costs. But this exposes them to a huge asset/liability mix match. You can't just \"sit out\" a temporary market dip. Remember Bill Hwang? If housing dips in the short term $OPEN have NO CHOICE but to liquidate at a huge loss. Which brings me to the next point.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) $OPEN loves to talk about \"contribution profit\", but the reality is that they only book profits when it is convenient. \n",
      "\n",
      "Real estate inventory is NOT marked to market, so as long as they don't sell the shit houses, they don't report contribution losses. This is the reason why Zillow took a huge writedown when they wound down iBuying. This is literally it's not loss until you sell meme, but in real life, practiced by a $13B company. Now pretend you are the CEO of $OPEN, would you sell houses at a loss? Fuck no, in fact you would buy as many fucking houses as possible so you can cherry pick the wins and hold the rest. Inventory is up $6 BILLION from the end of 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) they have no money to fund growth, so they have to take on more and more debt\n",
      "\n",
      "$OPEN is bleeding, but it still needs to put down cash for the equity portion of the mortgage, so what do they do? You can't keep issuing equity because that will tank the stock, so why not try SENIOR DEBT and high interest debt? Mezz mortgage debt was fetching 10% interest last quarter, and they issued senior debt to get $1B in cash to put into houses. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Path to $0. This is a highly capital intensive business, which was a big reason why Zillow said fuck it we'd rather bee SaaS. Because $OPEN is bleeding money, This insatiable appetite for capital will slow down growth considerably, because no one is going to keep giving $OPEN billions of dollars to blow, leaving $OPEN with no choice but to start selling their shit houses and taking losses as opposed to buying more houses and holding the losers, this will cause a domino effect because the capital market will stop giving them capital to plop into more houses, which sits under a pile of senior mortgage debt, leading to less leads, less revenue,  and even less capital and MOAR losses. Remember when that happens $OPEN will STILL owe money to senior debtors. When no one is giving them money to buy houses and and labor expense is bleeding the company dry, plus billions in debt, there is only one way out. https://c.tenor.com/PW5xIUYKjB0AAAAC/declare-bankrupt.gif\n",

Also, the Vancouver port is the fastest major port in terms of shipping from Asia to the East coast of the US. This port is responsible for shipping your products like AMD or NVIDIA. Nvidia grew by 0.6 billion last quarter what if part of that 0.6 billion in growth is tied up in Vancouver right now or your other favorite company?.

      "Everyone should’ve heard of these little JPEGs making millions, the new form of art, zoomers’ salary magnets. Non Familiar Toddlers (can’t say it cause I get cockblocked but read the initials). Disney and many other companies have embraced the concept of virtual art. Disney released its first official Disney collection on November 6th.  Of course they sold out. According to my estimations, in the past 4 months Disney has made over $20 million in the sales of Non Familiar Toddlers, exploring this sector with Marvel first and now with other Disney and Pixar characters. The number is closer to $22 million if we count virtual unique comic sales. Disney made $7 million just last week when their “Golden Moments” collection debuted on Veve. Not only this, but they will be making recurring 6% in licensing fees each time the Non Familiar Toddler is sold. As you can expect there are already sales worth $10K, of which Disney will earn $600 each, on an open market where there are more than 100 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers just in this last collection. In total Disney published over 585 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers which are constantly sold in the secondary market and Disney gets a portion of each sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before November, Disney had only published collections from their Marvel products. This Golden Moments collection is just a glance of some Disney figures. This is, undoubtedly, one of the companies largest roster of individual, recognizable, influential characters. With their ownership of many major franchises and characters which are pop culture icons, this is a billion dollar opportunity that the company will be exploding in the coming months, and investors will start to notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with Meta and their Metaverse proposal, we have seen companies as $RBLX run over 30 points for just saying they’ll be involved in a meaningful way. It is just a matter of time for Disney to announce their participation in this new technology as well. With concepts from Virtual Parks to Virtual Sports arenas, Gaming, Apparel… you get what I am saying. It is literally imposible for this company not to be involved in a major way.\n",

Disney stock will enter parabolic territory after the news of Non Familiar Toddler sales catch on. Moreover sports are being relevant again and streaming services are pumping new shows and getting new customers at a very fast pace. Massive FOMO from both public and hedge funds when they see how much Disney can make with just images online. Fucking tendies for everyone after that.\n",
